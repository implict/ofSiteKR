#class ofMouseEventArgs

##Description



This class is integrated into the openframeworks events system. When a mouse event (mouse pressed, mouse released...) happens we record mouse information inside an object of the class. Used to send event messages. In the new openFrameworks release we can find a very ilustrative example about how to use events in openFrameworks.
