#class ofKeyEventArgs

##Description



This class is integrated into the openframeworks events system. When a key event (key pressed, key released) happens we record key information inside an object of the class. Used to send event messages. In the new openFrameworks release we can find a very ilustrative example about how to use events in openFrameworks.
